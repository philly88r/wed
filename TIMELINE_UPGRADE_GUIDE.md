# Wedding Timeline Upgrade Guide

This guide explains how to implement the enhanced timeline features we've developed for your wedding planning application.

## Overview of Changes

1. **Database Updates**:
   - Added a `priority` column to the `timeline_tasks` table
   - Updated status options to include 'in_progress' alongside 'todo' and 'completed'

2. **New Components**:
   - Created an `EnhancedTimeline` component that organizes tasks by month
   - Developed a new `TimelineV2` page that uses the enhanced timeline

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Run the Database Migration

First, you need to run the migration to update your database schema:

```bash
# Start your local Supabase instance
npx supabase start

# Run the migration
npx supabase migration up
```

If you're deploying to a production Supabase instance, you'll need to apply these migrations there as well.

### 2. Switch to the New Timeline Page

You have two options:

#### Option 1: Replace the existing Timeline page

Rename `TimelineV2.tsx` to `Timeline.tsx` (after backing up the original):

```bash
# Backup the original Timeline.tsx
mv src/pages/Timeline.tsx src/pages/Timeline.original.tsx

# Rename TimelineV2.tsx to Timeline.tsx
mv src/pages/TimelineV2.tsx src/pages/Timeline.tsx
```

#### Option 2: Add the new page as a separate route

Update your routing configuration to include the new TimelineV2 page and link to it from your navigation menu.

### 3. Features of the Enhanced Timeline

The new timeline includes:

- **Filtering**: Filter tasks by status, category, priority, and search terms
- **Grouping**: Group tasks by month for better organization
- **Priority Levels**: Mark tasks as low, medium, or high priority
- **Status Updates**: Track tasks as todo, in progress, or completed
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coding for priorities and status
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on all device sizes

### 4. Compatibility Notes

The new implementation is designed to be backward compatible with your existing database. It will:

1. First try to use the new `timeline_tasks` table structure
2. Fall back to the original table structure if needed
3. Automatically handle the presence or absence of the priority field

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check that your Supabase instance is running
2. Verify that the migration has been applied successfully
3. Check the browser console for any JavaScript errors
4. Ensure all required dependencies are installed

## Next Steps

Consider implementing these additional features:

1. Complete the Calendar View functionality
2. Add email notifications for upcoming tasks
3. Implement task assignment to specific people
4. Add task dependencies (tasks that depend on other tasks)
